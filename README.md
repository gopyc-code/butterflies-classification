- **Input**: Color images of size 224x224.
- **Datasets**:
  - **Train**: Contains 50 folders, each representing a class.
  - **Test**: Contains 250 images to classify.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy.

## Solution

- **best_model.pth**: [Pre-trained weights](https://mega.nz/file/T6AhmRrS#NsSYdKXo5p9Pk1lT3tMrNeV66eehGhVx-2Wj3WG3zHA) for the ResNet50 model.
- **solution.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with a step-by-step solution for the classification task.
